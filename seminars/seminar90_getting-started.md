Getting Started
===============

__NOTE__: The use of RPubs and GitHub and Gravatar will inevitably put information on a server that physically sits in the US! Jenny is working on some "consent" language so any students who use these sites for the class can confirm they are aware and OK with this. We can provide workarounds if you are unwilling to put info on a US server.

- Install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com)
- Install the [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com) git app
- Register an [RPubs](http://rpubs.com) account
- Register an [educational GitHub account](http://GitHub.com/edu)
- Upload your photo to [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) if you're comfortable with that
- Create a public GitHub repository named `stat540-2014-lastname-firstname` for lab work
- Create a private GitHub repository named `stat540-2014-lastname-firstname-hw` for assignments
- Add the profs and TAs as collaborators to your private GitHub repository
