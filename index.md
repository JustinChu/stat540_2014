### Google Group for Q & A (TAs will add students to group in due course)

[STAT540_2014](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stat540_2014)

### Time and Location

06 January 2014 - 07 April 2014

#### Lecture (Sec 201)
Time : Mon Wed 9:30 - 11am

Location : [ESB 4192](http://www.students.ubc.ca/classroomservices/buildings-and-classrooms/?code=ESB&room=4192)

#### Seminar / computing lab (S2A) -- REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED!
Time: *officially* runs Wed 12pm - 1pm; *unofficially* students are welcome to come after class around 11am and begin a ~1 hour guided analysis with TA support; TA will remain in the lab until 1pm to help those who start as 12pm and for general office hours.

Location: ESB 1042

### Prerequisites.

Officially none BUT here in reality ...

* Statistics: you should have already taken university level introductory statistics course.

* Biology: No requirements, but you are expected to learn things like the difference between a DNA and RNA and a gene and a genome.

* R: no experience required but be prepared to do *a lot* of self-guided learning. Go ahead and start now by [installing R](http://www.r-project.org/) and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "integrated development environment" (IDE) [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com)! Students are expected to run R on their own computer or a computer they have plenty of access to and control over. The best set-up, if possible, is to bring your own laptop to the computing seminars.

### Evaluation

* Homework. Two assignments worth 25 points each. Homework #1 will be assigned in early February and will be due in late February. Homework #2 will be assigned in early March and will be due in late March. *New for 2014: we may suggest/require that incremental progress be submitted along the way.*

* [Group project](project/index.html). Groups formed and projects conceived during January/February. Primary deliverable is a poster, presented in last class meeting. Each student also produces a short report. 40 points. More more information, [go here](project/index.html).

* 10 points for "other", e.g. participation in class, seminars, and the Google group, engagement with *small* computing exercises.
